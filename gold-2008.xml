The 'event is understood here as a general term covering any situation type (a state, activity, accomplishment, achievement, etc.) as expressed by the verb phrase of the construction. Unlike Tense Feature, which expresses event-external time and is deictic, Aspect Feature is event-internal and non-deictic, as it is not concerned with relating the time of the event to any other time point.

Aspect Property is assigned to clauses on the basis of semantics: an aspect value is selected for the clause from the range of aspect values available in the given language. Aspect Property is typically realised on the verb, but it may be found expressed multiply on different elements in the same clause. It may be found on more than one element of the verbal complex, or on verbs as well as certain adverbs in the same clause.

In the given language, the values of the Aspect Property are assigned to the designated elements as a consequence of semantic choice, and all the available options of particular aspect values expressing particular aspect meanings can be described with an Aspect Assignment System for that language. Since no languages have been found for which aspect values are assigned by an Aspect Distribution System (i.e. contextually, through agreement or government), Aspect Feature is not a Morphosyntactic Property.  Instead, it is a Morphosemantic Property only.

NOTE: Although the semantic basis for the Aspect Property are the distinctions identified in the internal temporal constituency of an event, aspect meanings frequently combine with tense, modal or other meanings expressing actionality distinctions. Hence, markers expressing aspect values are frequently portmanteaux realising combined TAM values.</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Aspirated" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/GlottalTimingProperty"><label>Aspirated</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">[Need comment]</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/AssumptiveEvidentiality" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/EvidentialityProperty"><label>AssumptiveEvidentiality</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">AssumptiveEvidentiality encodes the fact that the speaker came to believe the content of the expression through a possibly unsound inference procedure.

Hence, continuousness can be defined negatively as imperfectivity that is not habituality [Comrie 1976, 26-32], and it can be regarded as a sub-type of imperfectivity.

Typically, for an aspect value to be labelled as Continuous, the aspectual meaning has to minimally express continuousness, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings, or actionality distinctions.

Continuous aspectual meaning can be further subdivided into two types: progressive meaning and nonprogressive meaning. These two aspectual meanings may or may not be grammaticalised as separate aspect values.</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/ContlativeCase" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/CaseProperty"><label>ContlativeCase</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">ContlativeCase expresses that  the referent of the noun it marks is the location in the vicinity of which another referent is moving.

Most commonly, this tense meaning is referred to as 'future', because in absolute tense systems the deictic centre is the moment of speech. However, in relative tense systems, where the deictic centre can be moved to any point on the time line, it is more appropriate to refer to this temporal relation as 'posterior'.

The posterior temporal relation may obtain either in 'simple' or 'perfect' contexts.  Modelling of this distinction originates from [Reichenbach  1947], who suggested using a third point in time, 'reference point', to capture all possible tense distinctions. In all 'simple' temporal relations, the reference point coincides with the location of the event spoken about.  'Perfect' tense meanings are created when the reference point is separated and moved away from the event time, thus altering the viewing of the temporal location of the event even though the event's actual location with respect to the deictic centre remains the same.

Posterior temporal relationships obtaining in a 'perfect' context occur when the reference point is moved away from the event time. There are various logical possibilities for locating the reference point with respect to the other two points, though none of them seem to be typically grammaticalised as separate tenses.

Typically, for a tense value to be labelled as Future Tense, the tense meaning has to minimally express the posterior temporal relationship, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings.</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/GenderProperty" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/MorphosyntacticProperty"><label>GenderProperty</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">GenderProperty is the class of properties that are assigned to nouns on the basis of their inherent properties by an AssignmentSystem and required by the syntax to appear on the target in an AgreementSystem.

Glyphs are concatenated in a writing system to form orthographic parts and orthographic words. Consider the printed word 'apple'. This word contains two instances of the 'p' glyph, which is a subclass of Glyph. Instances of a Glyph share a similar shape and can be called 'shapemes'. The class Glyph is not the same as Grapheme. A Grapheme is a contrastive unit within a particular writing system. The notion of a glyph is relevant across writing systems. For instance, consider the symbol 'р' used in a printed instance of a Russian word 'русский'. Now consider the symbol 'p' used in the printed instance of an English word 'pickle'. Both symbols are instances of the same Glyph. They share the same general shape, but do not have the same phonemic value.</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/GrammarUnit" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/LinguisticUnit"><label>GrammarUnit</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">A GrammarUnit is the structural component of the linguistic sign and includes notions such as morpheme, syntactic word, and construction.

The decision that a situation is characteristic of an extended period of time is not in itself linguistic, but once it has been made, an explicitly habitual form can be used to describe it. Note that the classification of a situation as characteristic of a period of time is not derived directly from the comparison of their length or frequency; hence, the situation may be objectively either long or short, and either frequent or infrequent, with respect to the period it characterises. This is because the way we choose to characterise can ivolve a component which is objectively small in relation to the whole.

Typically, for an aspect value to be labelled as Habitual, the aspectual meaning has to minimally express habituality, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings, or actionality distinctions. Habituality can in principle be combined with any other semantic aspectual values appropriate to situations that can be protracted in time or iterated [Comrie 1976, 26-32].

By definition, a linguistic sign must have a form component (whose elements are phonological units), a grammatical component (whose elements are grammatical units), and a meaning component (whose elements are semantic units). The formal structure of a linguistic sign is determined by the grammar of a language. The information value of a linguistic sign, its meaning, is not fixed, but determined by the conventions of the language. The relation of form to meaning is largely arbitrary within a semiotic system. Signs are classified primarily according to what kinds of formal relations they participate in, and, secondly, according to their complexity (whether they are atomic or composed of other signs). Signs range from morphological and syntactic constructions to whole discourse segments [de Saussure 1983; Hervey 1979; Pollard and Sag 1994].</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/LinguisticSystem" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Abstract"><label>LinguisticSystem</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">LinguisticSystem is the class of languages, broadly construed.

Most commonly, this tense meaning is referred to as 'past', because in absolute tense systems the deictic centre is the moment of speech. However, in relative tense systems, where the deictic centre can be moved to any point on the time line, it is more appropriate to refer to this temporal relation as 'anterior'.

The anterior temporal relation may obtain either in 'simple' or 'perfect' contexts. Modelling of this distinction originates from [Reichenbach 1947], who suggested using a third point in time, 'reference point', to capture all possible tense distinctions. In all 'simple' temporal relations, the reference point coincides with the location of the event spoken about. 'Perfect' tense meanings are created when the reference point is separated and moved away from the event time, thus altering the viewing of the temporal location of the event even though the event's actual location with respect to the deictic centre remains the same. 

A common instance of an anterior temporal relationship obtaining in a 'perfect' context occurs when the reference point is moved away from the event time and located instead at the moment of speech. The event time is still anterior to the moment of speech, but it is viewed against a stretch of time which began at the event and continues up to the moment of speech --- e.g. the English I have read this book, I have seen John --- hence the interpretation that the event has an effect or is in some way still relevant at the moment of speech. In some languages (e.g. English) this tense meaning is labelled as (one of the uses of the) Present Perfect, in others (e.g. Polish) this meaning may be collapsed with the 'simple' anterior meaning and labelled simply as Past.

Typically, for a tense value to be labelled as Past Tense, the tense meaning has to minimally express the anterior temporal relationship, although it may additionally express other temporal relationships or aspectual and/or modal meanings. For example, when the usage of the Past Tense value is restricted to a semantically defined domain, it is conventional to add a further qualification to the label of the Past Tense value (e.g. Past Imperfective --- when the anterior temporal relationship is necessarily combined with an aspectual meaning of the Imperfective Aspect value, and grammaticalised as a single TAM category in the language).</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PaucalNumber" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/NumberProperty"><label>PaucalNumber</label><definitions/></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PejorativeEvaluative" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/EvaluativeProperty"><label>PejorativeEvaluative</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">An evaluative property of a noun that indicates the speaker regards the person or object being referred to with distaste, contempt, or displeasure [Valentine 2001,  190-193].</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PerfectTense" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/TenseProperty"><label>PerfectTense</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">A value of Tense Feature assigned to the designated element in the clause when the meaning selected for the clause is that intended to locate the event spoken about as anterior, simultaneous, or posterior to the deictic centre of the utterance, and additionally the reference point from which this event is viewed is separated and moved away from the event time. This alters the viewing of the temporal location of the event even though the event's actual location with respect to the deictic centre remains the same. 'Perfect' temporal relations contrast with 'simple' temporal relations in which the reference point coincides with the location of the event spoken about. Modelling of this distinction originates from [Reichenbach 1947].

There are two types of 'perfect' context which may lead to separate tense values:

(1) The first type occurs when the reference point is moved away from the event time and instead located after the event time. A common example occurs with an anterior temporal relationship, when the reference point is moved from the event time to the moment of speech. The event time is anterior to the moment of speech, but it is viewed against a stretch of time which began at the event and continues up to the moment of speech --- e.g. the English I have read this book, I have seen John --- hence the interpretation that the event has an effect or is in
some way still relevant at the moment of speech. [Note that in some languages (e.g. English) this tense meaning is labelled as (one of the uses of the) Present Perfect, in others (e.g. Polish) this meaning may be collapsed with the 'simple' anterior meaning and labelled simply as
Past.] The interpretation of this type of the perfect often includes at least two related but distinguishable uses: the resultative perfect (Someone has stolen my purse) and the experiential perfect (I have read this book before) [Dahl and Velupillai 2005,271].

(2) The second type occurs when the reference point is moved away from the event time and instead located before the event time. A common example occurs with a simultaneous temporal relationship, when the reference point is moved from the event time and located before the moment of speech. The event time is still simultaneous with the moment of speech, but it is viewed against a stretch of time which began at the reference point and continues up to the moment of speech --- e.g. the English I have lived here [for ten years] --- hence the interpretation that the event which began in the past extends up to the moment of speech. [Note that in some languages (e.g. English) this tense meaning is labelled as (one of the uses of the) Present Perfect, in others (e.g. Polish) this meaning may be collapsed with the 'simple' simultaneous meaning and labelled simply as Present.] The interpretation of this type of the perfect is often referred to as the universal perfect or perfect of persistent situation.

Typically, for a tense value to be labelled as Perfect Tense, the tense meaning has to minimally express the meaning resulting from the separation of the reference point from the event time, although it may additionally express other temporal, aspectual, or modal meanings.</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PerfectiveAspect" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/AspectProperty"><label>PerfectiveAspect</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">A value of Aspect Property assigned to the designated element in the clause when the meaning selected for the clause is that which indicates that the event spoken about is to be viewed as a bounded whole, looked at from outside, without necessarily distinguishing any of its internal structure [Comrie 1976,16ff).

In English, phasal distinctions are expressed by auxiliary-headed constructions, like the inceptive, progressive, and perfect constructions, whose head verbs express the aspectual class of the denoted situation. The aspectual class of the denoted situation differs from that of the reference situation [Michaelis 1998,xv]. An event may have a beginning and an end, a middle portion (continuing or changing), and also an ensuing result or an altered state. These are considered to be the various "phases" of an event. A speaker may talk about an event from the point of view of any of these individual phases, and his language may have inflectional (or other type of) markers for representing these distinctions. Since such markers indicate distinctions in the temporal structure of an event, we may regard them as belonging to the category of aspect. It has been suggested [Dik 1989, 186] that these may be grouped under a subcategory (or "level") of aspect called "phasal aspect".

However, in relative tense systems, where the deictic centre can be moved to any point on the time line, it is more appropriate to refer to this temporal relation as 'simultaneous'.

It is important to note --- for all tense values, but in particular for the Present Tense --- that the 'times' which are used to locate the event, the deictic centre, and the reference point, may or may not be 'points' on the time line. Conventionally, these concepts are considered neutral with regard to whether they are points or intervals of time longer than a point. In a formal model of tense meanings they could, for example, be represented as sets (of points): in order to capture temporal distinctions, the notion of an event being 'simultaneous with the moment of speech', may be understood as (the set of) event time (points) and (the set of) speech time (points) having a non-empty intersection. Hence, this semantic model of the Present Tense value may include the interpretation of the present as 'universal' or 'generic'.

Tense Property is assigned to clauses on the basis of semantics: a tense value is selected for the clause from the range of tense values available in the given language. Tense Property is typically realised on the verb, but it may be found expressed multiply on different elements in the same clause. For example, tense may be found on more than one element of the verbal complex (e.g. in Kayardild [Evans 2003] or  Paamese [Crowley 2002, 68], or on verbs as well as on certain spatial and temporal adverbs and certain prepositions in the same clause (e.g. in Malagasy [Randriamasimanana 1981, 355-367],  [Keenan and Polinsky 1998, 566-567].

In the given language, the values of the Tense Property are assigned to the designated elements as a consequence of semantic choice, and all the available options of particular tense values expressing particular tense meanings can be described with a Tense Assignment System for that language. Since no languages have been found for which tense values are assigned by a Tense Distribution System (i.e. contextually, through agreement or government), Tense Property is not a Morphosyntactic Property. Instead, it is a Morphosemantic Property only.</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Term" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/LinguisticDataStructure"><label>Term</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">A specific string representing an entity within some scientific domain.</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/TerminativeAspect" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/AspectProperty"><label>TerminativeAspect</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">Denotes the termination of an event [Bhat 1999, 92].</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/TerminativeCase" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/CaseProperty"><label>TerminativeCase</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">[Need comment]</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Termset" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/LinguisticDataStructure"><label>Termset</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">A set of scientific terms used as part of an annotation system, usually the standard terms from a particular linguistic theory.</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/TertiaryPredicator" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/Predicator"><label>TertiaryPredicator</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">TertiaryPredicator is the class of syntactic words that take three required arguments.</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/ThirdPerson" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PersonProperty"><label>ThirdPerson</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">Third Person is a person property that refers to the non-participant (other than the speaker and the addressee) [Crystal 1997, 285].</definition></definitions></concept><concept uri="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/ThirdPersonObviative" parent="http://purl.org/linguistics/gold/PersonProperty"><label>ThirdPersonObviative</label><definitions><definition lang="eng">ThirdPersonObviative is a person property that  refers to one or more non-participants that are in some way further removed from the speaker than other non-particpants.
